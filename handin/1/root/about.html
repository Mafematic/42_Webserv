        <h2><strong>Tech Tales: Three Cities, One Code</strong></h2>
        <p>In the forests of Lausitz, Steffen spent his days tinkering with old computers in his uncle’s workshop. Code felt like solving puzzles with infinite answers, and he loved every challenge.</p>
        <p>In a small village in Brandenburg, Florian sketched website designs on scraps of paper, dreaming of bringing ideas to life on a screen.</p>
        <p>In the heart of Berlin, Friedrich thrived on the city’s energy. He dreamed of building apps that people couldn’t live without.</p>
        <p>They met at 42 Berlin, where their shared passion for software development turned into friendship. Together, they built a webserver app for their final project. Steffen handled the backend, Florian crafted the design, and Friedrich integrated the frontend.</p>
        <p>Their webserver launched quietly but grew quickly, connecting people across their regions. Late nights, debugging sessions, and laughter bound them together.</p>
        <p><em>“We did it,”</em> Steffen said.</p>
        <p><em>“And we’re just getting started,”</em> Friedrich replied.</p>
        <p>Florian smiled. <em>“From three places, one idea.”</em></p>
        <p>They weren’t just developers. They were builders of connections, tied by friendship and code.</p>
